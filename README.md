# kaej.net! #
this is a little site i cooked up to learn next.js! nothing crazy for now but it'll get refactored and polished and put into better form soon enough
sound design and stuff by me too (remember to [stream kwau](https://open.spotify.com/artist/47AOxDNgXOfcPeWEF3k2Kq?si=1k8kEFoWSaC9CGylo62oXQ&nd=1))
this will be nicer in the future but before until then
